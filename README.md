# KMCalcium
Kuramoto Model Simulation for the calcium dynamics obtained from Two-Photon Microscopy

The attached .pdf file is the report that explains the work done in the project.
After downloading & extracting the zip file, you can run the kuramoto_for_calcium_simulation.ipynb file in a jupyter notebook to see the pipeline and analysis.

You may need to `pip install read-roi` before you run the jupyter file but the rest of the modules used are pretty general libraries that almost everyone has.
